  summary: Cancel a payment.
  description: |
    The payment will be voided if possible meaning the payment source will not be charged & the payment will never settle.
    Otherwise, the payment will be refunded meaning the payment source will be charged & the payment will be refunded from deductions of future settlements.
    Not all payments are eligible to be cancelled.

    A successful response does *not* mean the payment has been cancelled; it only means the cancellation request is sucessfully submitted.
